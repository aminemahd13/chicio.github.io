*In this new post of the series "Learning Blender" I will talk about textures*

---

In the [previous post of the series "Learning Blender"](TODO) we talked about materials in Blender. In this post we 
will start to learn how to use textures.  
As you may already know, textures are useful to add realism to a material. We can manage textures from the texture 
tab inside the properties panel. From that panel we can create a new texture by clicking on the + button. After 
creating a new texture, some options are displayed that let us customize how the texture looks like. The type of 
texture we select changes the options displayed: there will be a specific section of properties for the type we 
choose.

In the various section of the texture panel we have the "influence section". This section is very important because 
it let us customize how the texture will affect the final material. This means that we can use textures to change not
 only the final color of the material but also the shading components, geometry, specular highlight and so on.
