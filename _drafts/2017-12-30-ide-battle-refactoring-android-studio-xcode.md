*In this posts I will talk about why I started to hate XCode and I fall in love with Android Studio and the 
various Jetbrains IDEs.*

IDE, *Integrated Development Environment*, are the software developer toolboxes. In this new series of post 
about IDEs, I will review some of them. I will start from the most common ones used to develop mobile apps: XCode and
 Android Studio.  
When I started to work at [lastminute.com group](http://www.lastminutegroup.com "lastminute.com group") my knowledge 
of the Android platform was very limited (in fact I was an iOS developer). But... [lastminute.com group](http://www.lastminutegroup.com "lastminute.com group") 
is an [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "agile software development") company 
and one of the technique we use is [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming "pair 
programming"): two programmers work at the same feature on the same workstation. As reported on Wikipedia, one of the
 the main advantages of pair programming is knowledge sharing:
 
 >Knowledge is constantly shared between pair programmers, whether in the industry or in a classroom, many sources 
 suggest that students show higher confidence when programming in pairs, and many learn whether it be from tips on 
 programming language rules to overall design skill. In "promiscuous pairing", each programmer communicates and 
 works with all the other programmers on the team rather than pairing only with one partner, which causes knowledge 
 of the system to spread throughout the whole team. Pair programming allows the programmers to examine their 
 partner's code and provide feedback which is necessary to increase their own ability to develop monitoring 
 mechanisms for their own learning activities.

This is way I started to work with my colleague [Francesco Bonfadelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbonfadelli/ 
"Francesco Bonfadelli") a senior Android, iOS and Backend developer. During our pair programming sessions I learned a 
lot about developing mobile apps for the Android platform. One of the thing I learned in the first few days is the 
difference between the IDEs: Android Studio and XCode. After seeing the coding speed that Francesco was able to reach 
during the implementation of a new feature on Android, and how much slower it is to do the same things on XCode for 
iOS, I realized how much more advanced is Android Studio with is set of features in comparison with XCode.  
In this post I will briefly analyze the two IDEs by describing their main features. I will then show you why I think 
that, at the time of this writing, Android Studio is superior to XCode in particular for what concern its 
refactoring/write/completion tools.


### XCode

.....


### Android Studio


....


### Coding at the speed of light with Jetbrains refactoring/writing/completion tools

....


### And the winner is... (you already know it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
