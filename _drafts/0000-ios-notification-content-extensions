*In this post I will talk about iOS notification customization with Notification Content Extension*

---

During a workshop I recently attended I had the opportunity to discover anew interesting extension type: Notification 
Content App Extension. This extension has been added by Apple in iOS 10 let you customize the UI of your 
notification. In this way you can send more engaging notification to your users :grin:.  
Let's see in an example how you can create a notification with custom UI using this extension. To do that I will use 
some assets taken from the [nasa photo journal](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/ "nasa photo journal"). You can 
find the complete example contained in this post [in this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Notification-Content-Extension-Example "notification content extension example"). 
Let's start from the beginning: add a Notification Content extension to your app. To do that just select the + button
 in the target section that appears after selecting the xcodeproj file.
