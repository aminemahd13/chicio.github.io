In this post I will show you how to create it by leveraging the Metatype Type and the Hashable protocol.*

#### Conclusion

You can find all the code shown in this post [in this Github repo](https://github.com/chicio/SwiftUI-CustomTabBar "custom tab bar swiftui"). Apple has done a great job with SwiftUI and I hope that the framework will receive in the future updates all the missing UIKit pieces (while still missing a [lot of stuff on the web/Safari side](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app.html)). If you already used powerful declarative framework like React or React Native you will feel at home (seems like a copy of each other :blush:). Stay tuned for other post about SwiftUI and Combine soon. :heart:.
