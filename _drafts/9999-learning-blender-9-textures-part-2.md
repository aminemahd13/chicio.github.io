*In this new post of the series "Learning Blender" I will talk about other textures techniques*

In the [previous post of the series "Learning Blender"](TODO) we talked about textures in Blender. In this post we 
will continue to learn how to use textures in Blender.  
We will start with normal maps. This kind of texture let us simulate rough surfaces without adding geometric
 details to the mesh. We can set bump mapping in the texture tab under the Influence section. By checking the 
 Geometry -> Normal checkbox we let the texture be used as a reference to modify the normals of the mesh so that we 
 can simulate additional geometry details. It is possible to modify the quality of the map by adjusting the option in
  the same panel.
