*In this new post of the series "Learning Blender" I will continue to talk about the fundamental of modeling in Blender.*

In the [previous post of the series "Learning Blender"](TODO) we introduced the first part of basics of modeling. 
Let' continue our exploration with other useful tool we can use for modeling.  
Let's start with Sculpt mode. We can enable it in the editing/interaction mode selector in the bottom bar of the 3D 
window. In this mode you can literally sculpt you mesh. It possible to customize the sculpt mode by setting some of 
its properties:

* radius of the sculpt
* feather of the sculpt, that changes how the sculpt fall-off
* auto smooth
* add/subtract to pull in/out vertices while sculpting

Sculpt mode support also paint textures and strokes. But more important it support symmetry: by selecting and axis 
any change on one side will be mirrored on the other one.  
Another interesting option is the edge loop modeling. Basically this means that if we select a edge loop with "alt +
 right click" in edit mode/edge select mode, we can modify the edge loop by using the 3D axis that are shown after the
  selection.  
  The next tool available for modeling is the extrude tool. With this tool we can modify our geometry and more 
  details. In particular, we can use it to create branches, legs and other parts that are out of the main body of the
   mesh. We can activate the extrude under Mesh tools -> Extrude Region/Individual. The extrude region will push out 
   the elements selected as a single block. The extrude individual will extrude the elements selected individually.
