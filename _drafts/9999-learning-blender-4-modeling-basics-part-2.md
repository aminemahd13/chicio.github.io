*In this new post of the series "Learning Blender" I will continue to talk about the fundamental of modeling in Blender.*

In the [previous post of the series "Learning Blender"](TODO) we introduced the first part of basics of modeling. 
Let' continue our exploration with other useful tool we can use for modeling.  
Let's start with Sculpt mode. We can enable it in the editing/interaction mode selector in the bottom bar of the 3D 
window. In this mode you can literally sculpt you mesh. It possible to customize the sculpt mode by setting some of 
its properties:

* radius of the sculpt
* feather of the sculpt, that changes how the sculpt fall-off
* auto smooth
* add/subtract to pull in/out vertices while sculpting

Sculpt mode support also paint textures and strokes. But more important it support symmetry: by selecting and axis 
any change on one side will be mirrored on the other one.  
...edges and edges loops
