*Second post for the "Learning Blender" series. This time we will learn how to select and move objects*

---

In the [first post of the series "Learning Blender"](TODO ) we learned how the user interface is composed and the 
most important commands to navigate inside a scene. This time we will be focus on selecting and moving objects inside
 the 3D view.  
We can *select an object* by using the *right button of your mouse*. If your're on the macbook like me, the right mouse 
is emulated in some ways (my personal preferences is to use two fingers to emulate a right click). To *select multiple
 objects* you can hold the *shift button and select with a right click the objects* you want. The objects that you will 
 select will be marked in the outliner editor, with a little circle, and in the 3D view with a little border. The 
 color of the border will change based on the theme you selected. In the screenshot below you can see that I selected
  2 of the 3 objects in the scene. If you have multiple objects selected, the last one will have a different border. 
  In my case the cube is the last object selected.

To deselect an object you can just right click on it again (hold the shift button if you have multiple object 
selected and you don't want to lose the selection). You can also *select all the objects* in a scene, including 
cameras and lights, by pressing the *"a" key*.  
There's also a select menu that gives more control over the selections you can do. In particular, we have the "Circle
 select", that lets you select objects based on a circle pattern of selection, and the "Border select", that lets you
 select objects based on a squared pattern of selection. There are also other option to select random objects or 
 invert the current selection.
