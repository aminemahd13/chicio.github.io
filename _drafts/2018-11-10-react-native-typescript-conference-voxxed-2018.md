*In this post I will talk about my first experience as a speaker at a conference: a talk about React, React Native 
and Typescript with Alessandro Romano.*

---

In the last few months I talked a lot about [React Native and Typescript](articolo setup). In the team where I work 
at lastminute.com group I acquired a strong knowledge of the Typescript + React + React Native technology stack. 
There has been also some few changes in the team: Emanuele Ianni, (do you remember I already talked about him [in my 
previous post?]), my technical team leader left the company. He was supposed to do a talk at Voxxed 2018 about our 
journey as a team into the world of React + React Native + Typescript. So I got the opportunity to go to the Voxxed to 
replace him as a co-speaker of Alessandro Romano, my other colleague selected as a speaker for this event. 
Alessandro, also known as "the clean", is a senior frontend developer with many years of experience that just got 
graduated from University of Insubria in Varese (do you remember I also [already talked about him]?).   
In this post I will talk about all the process we went into from the first draft preparation until the talk.

# Slide preparation
Let's start from the slide preparation. I started to work on the presentation with Alessandro two months before the 
event. We decided to structure our talk like as a story telling. We started by describing how our team was composed 
and how we transformed into the mythological creature of the fullstack developer thanks to our new technology stack 
for the frontend side:

* TypeScript as common language
* React for the frontend of the customer area (manage of flight and hotel bookings) of our websites
* React Native for the frontend of the mobile apps of our main brands

After this introduction we created a section for each of the tecnology above were we described the pros and cons of 
each one. Last but not least we presented a real use case were we described how we implemented the same feature for 
our mobile apps and our customer area using the technology above and how we shared the domain models between the two 
enviroment using a pure TypeScript library.  


# Company dry run
When the presentation was ready we planned an internal dry run. We usually call this kind of meetings "schiscia time"...


# Feedback and review


# The talk


# Conclusion
