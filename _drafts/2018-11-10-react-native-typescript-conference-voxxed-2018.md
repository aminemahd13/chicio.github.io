*In this post I will talk about my first experience as a speaker at a conference: a talk about React, React Native 
and Typescript with Alessandro Romano.*

In the last few months I talked a lot about [React Native and Typescript](articolo setup). In the team where I work 
at lastminute.com group I acquired a strong knowledge of the Typescript + React + React Native technology stack. 
There has been also some few changes in the team: Emanuele Ianni, (do you remember I already talked about him [in my 
previous post?]), my technical team leader left the company. He was supposed to do a talk at Voxxed 2018 about our 
journey as a team into the world of React + Typescript. So I get the opportunity to go to the Voxxed to 
replace him as a co-speaker of Alessandro Romano, my other colleague selected as a speaker for this event. 
Alessandro, also known as "the clean", is a senior frontend developer with many years of experience that just got 
graduated from University of Insubria in Varese (do you remember I also [already talked about him]?).   
In this post I will talk about all the process we went into from the first draft preparation until the talk.


# Slide preparation


# Company dry run


# Feedback and review


# The talk
