*In this post I will talk about my first experience as a speaker at a conference: a talk about React, React Native 
and Typescript with Alessandro Romano.*

---

In the last few months I talked a lot about [React Native and Typescript](articolo setup). In the team where I work 
at lastminute.com group I acquired a strong knowledge of the Typescript + React + React Native technology stack. 
There has been also some few changes in the team: [Emanuele Ianni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueleianni/ "Emanuele Ianni"), (do 
you remember I already talked about him [in my previous post?]()), my technical team leader left the company. He was supposed to do a talk at Voxxed 2018 about our 
journey as a team into the world of React + React Native + Typescript. So I got the opportunity to go to the Voxxed to 
replace him as a co-speaker of [Alessandro Romano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroromano92/ "Alessandro Romano"),
 my other colleague selected as a speaker for this event. 
Alessandro, also known as "the clean", is a senior software developer with many years of experience that just got 
graduated from University of Insubria in Varese (do you remember I [already talked also about him]()).   
The title of talk is: **"React (Native) & Typescript": A journey to a unified team using a common language**.
In this post I will talk about all the process we went into from the first draft preparation until the talk :grin:.

# Slide preparation
Let's start from the slide preparation. I started to work on the presentation with Alessandro two months before the 
event. We decided to structure our talk like as a story telling. We started by describing how our team was composed 
and how we transformed into the mythological creature of the fullstack developer thanks to our new technology stack 
for the frontend side:

* TypeScript as common language
* React for the frontend of the customer area (manage of flight and hotel bookings) of our websites
* React Native for the frontend of the mobile apps of our main brands

After this introduction we created a section for each of the technology above were we described the pros and cons of 
each one. Last but not least we presented a real use case were we described how we implemented the same feature for 
our mobile apps and our customer area using the technology above and how we shared the domain models between the two 
environment using a pure TypeScript library.  

# Company dry run, feedback and final present
When the presentation was ready we planned an internal dry run. We usually call this kind of meetings "schiscia time"
 because they are planned during lunch time: the participant will enjoy their launch while the speakers show their 
 stuff. So we planned our "schiscia time" for the 8th October.  
 A lot of colleagues attended the talk. We received a lot of feedback that we collected to start a review process 
 from which we created the final presentation. The two major observation we received were:
 
 * **less coding**. We created a lot of slides with screenshots taken directly from our IDEs with a lot of code, 
 especially in the section of the presentation where we described the new technology stack we "married". They 
 were not easy to read and on some of the slides they didn't bring to much value to the presentation. So we decided 
 to remove them. The only slides with code that we kept were the ones in the section "Share the code: cross selling 
 feature" where we present a real use case of development on our products. On this slides we changed the IDEs 
 screenshots with some formatted code using a syntax highlighter (and honestly, after that change the slides looked 
 much more beautiful :heart_eyes:).
 * **more focus on the journey**. A lot of our colleagues told us that from the presentation they didn't feel what it
  took to transform ourselves from platform specific developer to the mythological creature of the fullstack developer.
   In our presentation there were a lot details about React, React Native and TypeScript but not as much on our 
   workflow with the new technology stack. In fact after choosing React + React Native + TypeScript we started to:
   * do pair programming without considering the technology skills 
   * do end-to-end user stories, from the backend service to the frontend (mobile app and web) 

So we started to review the slides and we basically created a new presentation :smile:. It took us almost a week to. 
 After the review we made 2 simulations of the entire presentation during the week before the event to be more 
 confident. Last but not least, the Human Resources department gave us a company t-shirt to promote our company brand
  at the conference.

# The talk

Then the day of the talk arrived. The Voxxed Days 2018 in Ticino was set to take place on 20th of October. We arrived
 at the Palazzo dei Congressi in Lugano at 8.45 AM. We check in and got our speaker badge. Then we moved in the rest 
 section for a breakfast.
 
 ![voxxed 2018 breakfast and badge](/assets/images/posts/voxxed-2018-breakfast.jpg "voxxed 2018 breakfast and badge")  

Our talk was planned at 2.30 PM so we had time to attend some other session. At 11.50 PM we decided to do a last 
presentation simulation to review some details and then we wen to lunch. At 2.00 PM we started to feel the strain. 
The start of our talk was really close. We entered in the room of our session at 2.15 and we did the setup of our 
laptop for the presentation.

Then the room started to fill in. As schedule at 14.30 we started our presentation. The presentation went smooth.
We kept the scheduled time per slide we planned in our simulation. The change of speaker between the various part of 
the presentation worked perfectly. At the end we answered to some questions and we received applause from the 
audience.
