*First part of a short series of post in which I describe my two latest project: ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger. In this
first post I will talk about why I started to develop them.*

Recently I bought a new car. After a lot of search I finally decided to buy the Renault Clio 2017 1.5 dci. I love this
car. It has been a big step forward on my previous car. One of the most interesting feature of this car is its media
entertainment system: the Media Nav Evolution system. This system has a 7'' touchscreen with map integration and a basic
 smartphone integration with Siri voice recognition and phone call support.

One of the thing the get my attention was the ability to start to listen to my mp3 collection while I'm driving (on my
previous car I had a standard cd player). So I prepared an usb key with some of my mp3 and I started to listen to them.
Now one thing get my attention: some of my songs where displayed on the touchscreen with information about the album and
 the cover of the album. I though: "Whoahh this is very cool!! I need to start to fill my mp3 with all this information".
 This is exactly the moment where my journey into the development of ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger, but I was not yet
 aware of it :grin:

So I sat in front of my mac, I opened iTunes and I started to tag my mp3 files. I saved them on a usb key and I went to
my car to test them. The result was the following:

What the f**k is going on??!!?! :angry: The title and the album where displayed but the cover was not show on the screen.
So came back to my desk and started to download some native macOS app that let the user edit what I discovered was
called *ID3 tag*.
